## Overview

This was me trying to figure out tailwind in a project a little less overwhelming than the one frontend mentor wanted me to do, because thank you but let's be honest you believed WAY to much in me.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### What I learned

oh the struggle. tailwind is out to get me. i had trouble pretty much every step of the way. i had trouble installing it, configuring it, understanding it, using it, displaying it, fixing it. everything. 

i think my biggest issue is that if the project uses tailwind vscode crashes every five goddamn minutes and that creates a quite frustrating atmosphere in the studio.

now, my laptop crashes all the freaking time as a routine, a habit, a quirk, a little idiosyncrasy—it crashed so much that i eventually uninstalled windows 11 because there was no way in heaven or earth this old grump could bear it. 
it still crashes, but i earned a few minutes (it went from crashing every 45 seconds to crashing every fifteen minutes, and on days when i'm particularly lucky, it goes two whole HOURS without crashing!) but tailwind undoes all my progress.

also, it only works when the wind blows from east. if it doesn't really feel like it, i'll have to wait 40 minutes before the live server decides to show me what i'm writing is actaully doing something—which, for a LIVE server is a bit of a joke.

so, i learned i hate tailwind with all my heart, for reasons that have mainly to do with my old laptop but also because how in the hell is that html readable???? 

### Continued development

it took four days for this silly thing i don't want to think about how long it'll take for a slightly bigger project (a lot of it was due to the various crashings, but also because i have to look up everything).

but i guess that's just because i'm not used to it, so i'll try to stick with it a while longer. if this old grump lets me. hi laptop i love you please treat me well i'll give you a sticker ❤️

also i guess i have to group classes in some way to make it more readable and less repetitive, but i figured for such a small project where basically nothing gets reused i might as well just leave it as is and call it a day because this stupid project is starting to make me naseous.
